# PrestashopBaseModule
This is the base source code if you want to create a Prestashop module.

## How-To
You will see a lot of "modulename" in these files. Whether it's part of the filename, or part of the source code, you have to replace each and every occurency with the name of your module.

**!Important :** Use the same case when you replace !

Examples (let's say your module name is "Acme Test") :

* `Module Name` becomes `Acme Test`
* `ModuleName` becomes `AcmeTest`
* `modulename` becomes `acmetest`
* `Modulename` becomes `acmetest` (beware on this one)
* `moduleName` becomes `acmeTest`

There is just one thing that can be named without containing your module name. It's named "ModuleNameEntity" in the source files. For instance, the module "Fablab Tagger" has an entity named "Fablab". It could be named "Potato", it would still work.

Happy coding â˜º !
